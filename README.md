Example breeder marker assisted seedling selection tools for streamlining DNA testing and presentation operations

This repository contains two tools that have been frequently used to facilitate timely delivery of marker-assisted seedling selection data to the Washington State University apple breeding program. One of these tools was recognized in a chapter by Evans, citing my original poster at the Rosaceae Genomics Conference in Italy.

The second tool is an extension idea of the first that models the effects the marker-assisted culling decisions have on trait performance, for breeders to visualize the impact of these decisions.
