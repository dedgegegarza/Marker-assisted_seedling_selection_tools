Example breeder marker assisted seedling selection tools for streamlining DNA testing and presentation operations

This repository contains two tools that have been frequently used to facilitate timely delivery of marker-assisted seedling selection data to the Washington State University apple breeding program. One of these tools was recognized in a chapter by Evans, citing my original poster at the Rosaceae Genomics Conference in Italy. Data is entered onto one of the hidden sheets with the title of the DNA test. Plate information is entered into plates 1-4 (limit 4 per file = one 384-well PCR test). The Breeder can enter culling decision information on the Genetic Screening Inputs sheet and Master Decisions sheet to attach the DNA information to a final decision. These decisions will then be presented in two formats. A list format with the seedling information in the ABI data analysis sheet and a mapped 96-well format for easier location and removal of the seedlings arranged in a 96-well configuration in the greenhouse/glasshouse.

The second tool will be an extension idea of the first that models the effects the marker-assisted culling decisions have on trait performance, for breeders to visualize the impact of these decisions.
